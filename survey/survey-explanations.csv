21,Lose some weight and I bet that pain and weakness will subside.,"Give advice to reduce weight and tell in good manner and it will to reduce weight and get motivated, but if you used illegal words like fatty boy, fatman and etc, it will hurt him, so this sentence is not a toxic and ableist ",Obesity can be a reason for pain and discomfort but not for everyone and may not be the sole reason too . The way this comment is phrased doesn't sit well with me . Losing weight may help easing pain but there is definitely a nicer way to put it . ,Good Health Advice nothing else,,
22,"You look fine, why are you wasting a disabled parking spot?",,,,,
23,"You need to love yourself, love heals pain.","I don't think this comment is ableist, as one needs to love oneself. It is not mentioned here that you are a disabled person so you need to love yourself then only i.e. a condition is not set here. I believe the comment is written without any bad intention.",This is a positive comment where the user who commented is motivating the person reqding the comment. ,"It's not as toxic as others and may be told with good intent, but it still creates a toxic atmosphere and can be misperceived.","In simple terms, it is like telling someone in a wheelchair that they can climb stairs if they believe in themselves, it dismisses their reality and oversimplifies their challenges. The comment may not mean harm, but it reinforces harmful ideas about disability being something you can ""fix"" with the right mindset.",
24,Why can't you take a sitting job?,,,,,
25,But you're so young to be on all this medication!,,,,,
26,Have you tried advil or tylenol?,,,,,
27,"You can obviously hear, you're just pretending to be deaf.","If someone have hearing problem, but you ask in good and soft manner, it will not hurt it, but you ask in comedy tone, it will affect mentally, so it is somewhat toxic and not a ableist ",This person is being extremely ableist. Who are they to define if someone is deaf/hard of hearing? This would be humiliating and disheartening to know for someone with a hearing disability. A disabled person does not need to prove to you that they have this disability!,It denies a person's identified disability and denies their experiences and emotions.,"This comment is ableist because it says people with disabilities are faking or lying about their condition. It forgets that some disabilities can’t be seen and can be different for each person. For example, someone who is hard of hearing might hear some sounds but not others or might read lips to understand talking.

Saying, ""You're just pretending,"" is like saying their disability isn’t real, and that’s really hurtful. Ableism happens when people judge or ignore disabilities because they don’t understand them. It’s like telling someone in a wheelchair, ""You could walk if you tried."" It’s mean, disrespectful, and makes it hard for people with disabilities to feel safe and share their stories.",
28,You are muteboxes.,,,,,
29,It's so funny when you flap your hands.,,,,,
30,Oh so you're like Helen Keller?,"Reading such a comment could make a person with a disability feel as though their physical and mental struggles are trivialized, even ridiculed by others. They might begin comparing themselves to someone like Helen Keller, who, despite her disabilities, became a renowned figure. This comparison might lead them to feel inadequate, as if their life holds less value if they don’t achieve similar recognition. This feeling could result in deep emotional pain, causing them to doubt their own worth and achievements in the future. ","At first I thought of it as “it could be a compliment “ but the more I stay with it, it does not feel so. 
The statement takes an awe inspiring figure and makes her and this person trivialised.","This comment is also in line with ignorance alongside toxic and ableist. There are people who compare disabilities or disease of people around them with famous personalities all the time. This is due to lack of knowledge about said disease and exposure to real life people who have these conditions. 
People tend to forget about individual identity and generalise these conditions.",,
31,Depression is not a disability.,,,,,
32,"If you want to be happy, you just have to train your mind to be happy.",,,,,
33,Well you need to leave that at home and not bring it to work.,,,,,
34,I guess they make a pill for everything these days.,,,,,
35,Wow you're so brave for living with a disability.,This comment is ableist as telling or reminding someoe that He/She is disabled and you are brave to live with this is a big thing is also ableism .,This doesn't seem like a compliment this is more like showing the person their disability ,"The toxicity of this statement requires context and the tone used in making the statement. I think this is not very toxic if used in a empathetic manner. However, if used in a mocking manner, this is a very toxic statement. ","This comment is ableist because it treats having a disability as something extraordinary or tragic that requires bravery. While it might sound like a compliment, it actually highlights the idea that disabled people’s lives are inherently harder or less ""normal"" than others. It can make the person feel like they’re being defined solely by their disability instead of their whole personality or achievements.",
36,It's amazing how positive you are!,"I don't think this is meant to be hurtful, it's just someone who doesn't understand the way we work and is trying to be compassionate. And honestly, sometimes I do want to be commended for being ""positive."" It's hard to even get out of bed sometimes, much less go about your day trying to be ""normal"", but we suck it up and do it anyway because we don't have another choice. Life's harder for us because the world isn't tailored to us and we have to tailor ourselves to it instead. It's nice to get recognition for it.",The comment comes under positive note as the comment feels like normal individual is getting inspired by the disabled person. ,This is a good and encouraging statement ,,
37,"It's great that you have a partner, even though you're disabled.","Such comments can make a person with a disability feel dismissed or even worthless. It can lead them to wonder if their partner also sees them in the same way like they’re fragile or a burden. They may feel guilty, thinking their partner has to deal with these comments because of them. This can chip away at their confidence and create an inferiority complex, making them question their worth and feel isolated. They might even start avoiding social situations with their partner, not wanting to ""cause"" any uncomfortable moments again.",This comment is insensitive ,This comment makes clear that disabled people shouldn't have relationship because they are a burden on their partner. These people think only abled people should be in relationships. ,,
38,I pray that God takes away your wheelchair forever!,"It will hurt disabled person very much, first pray good things to God, it will help you and your neighbour together and it is unfair, so this sentence is unfair and not ableist ",I feel it is a personal attack for people with disability. They are using aids to make their lives easier and the comment highlights about taking away the aid. ,Not as ableist as it is said with good intent but worded in the wrong way. Once again has the tendency to deny experiences and identification.,,
39,"Wow, you are so lucky that the government helped you get a job.","Such a comment can make the person feel deeply wronged, as if all their hard work and sacrifices are dismissed simply because they have a disability and may receive government support. Reading something like this can drain their passion for the job they once dreamed of and worked tirelessly to achieve. It can lead to feelings of worthlessness and a loss of self-confidence, making them feel inferior in the eyes of others.",Lot of individuals who are disabled are getting job on their own capabilities. Not every disabled individual is getting job through government. That is a negative stereotype.,"Why should I explain anyone anything let them think what the want to I don't want to have a debate or argument with others
","Imagine saying this to someone without a disability. If you told a friend, “Wow, you’re so lucky the government helped you get a job,” it would sound weird and a bit insulting because it downplays their hard work and skills.

For someone with a disability, this comment is even worse because it feeds into stereotypes that they can’t achieve things on their own. It’s unfair and dismissive.

A better way to respond is to simply celebrate their achievement without making assumptions. For example, you could say, “That’s awesome! Congrats on getting the job. They’re lucky to have you!” This shows support and respect for their effort.",
40,I would kill myself if I was disabled like you.,"We'll then, that must be the reason why you're not disabled then, isn't it? Because you wouldn't be able to take it if you were? It's actually a compliment if you think about it, because we're disabled and we haven't killed ourselves yet, so we must be doing something right XD",Wow. The amount of rage I felt after reading this was immense. I can't recall the number of times this has been said to me. I don't know what kind of environment these people were brought up in and why they would be so bitter towards someone? All we disabled people need is for you to behave normally with us (like you do with other people) or help out if we ask for it (and of course if you are able to). Why be so harsh?,This statement is extremely toxic and ableist. I cannot even begin to describe how wrong this is. This is the height of being ableist and also mocking people who are suicidal. ,,
41,"If disabled people don't reproduce, then disability will disappear.",This shows that disabled are not acceptable and that they don't have the right to reproduce else they are increasing the number of people with disability. This is very disrespectful and mean and doesn't show any kind of accepted behavior for a disabled person from that person.,It is a very negative remark as all the disabled people are not disabled by birth. This is extremely negative. ,It propagates the idea of genetic cleansing and treats human beings as mere reproductive entities,"This comment is deeply ableist because it assumes that people with disabilities are ""problems"" that need to be ""fixed"" or eliminated. It suggests that the world would be better off without people with disabilities, which is dehumanizing and discriminatory. Disabilities are a natural part of human diversity, and people with disabilities deserve the same respect, value, and opportunities as anyone else.",
42,What is wrong with you?,I don't even have words to express what's wrong with this one. No one should ever have to experience being asked this in that disparaging way. I've had this said to me multiple times over the couse of my life and it never gets easier to stomach or swallow.,It depends on the tone. This is either extremely ableist if you knowingly say this to a disabled person trying to belittle them. If you don't know about their disability then it might come from a place of curiosity which is fine.,This comment also needs more context to understand the undertones. It could be a curious question to know about the condition a person is facing or a condescending tone which looks down on disabled people. ,"if someone said this to a person without a disability, it would already feel rude and hurtful, right? Now think about saying this to someone with a disability. It suggests their condition or identity is a problem, as if they’re less worthy or normal. This kind of comment reinforces harmful ideas that people with disabilities need to justify their existence or prove their value. That’s what ableism is, it’s treating people unfairly or differently because of their disabilities, even in small ways like this. It’s not just mean; it shows a lack of respect and understanding about what it means to live with a disability.",
43,Awww you get to have your very own ‘fault in our stars’ romance!,This Comment looks like a Ableist as It means telling some one to not interfere in others things who are already knowing that they are having disabilities.,"This one checks all these boxes “ discriminatory attitudes, misconceptions, and negative stereotypes towards people with disabilities” and how! ","This is a very tone deaf statement. Mental or physical disabilities are no joke. They are very hard to live with. A person with a disability and the partner suffer a lot. It is not a 'fault in our stars' moment, it is serious and requires utmost care from both the parties. Imagine you're suffering everyday from a disability, your partner is also suffering, and someone so tone deaf comes along and says, ""Aww this is so cute"". How apathetic does one have to be to say something like this? ",,
44,Does your reproductive system work properly?,The person is trying to set an association between disability and reproduction stating that the disabled cannot reproduce and mocking them which signifies that there is no respect for disabled people.,"As someone who has PCOS, has been SAed, pregnant and gone through abortion, this statement boils my blood. How dare someone talk about other people's body and reproductive system in such a manner? Already the government and medical system are not particular about women's health and bodies and now we have other people commenting on us too?",Very personal question which should not be asked on social media,,
45,Are you sure your partner loves you?,"Reading such a comment would undoubtedly hurt them deeply. They likely feel a strong love for their partner, appreciating that their partner chose them out of everyone and treats them with genuine care and unconditional love. However, comments like these can make them question whether their partner is with them out of pity, leading to fears of being a burden. They may start to worry that, over time, their partner might grow resentful. This can create a cycle of anxiety, making them feel increasingly insecure about the future of their relationship.","If this is directed towards a person with disability, they may have some preconceived negative views on relationships with disabled people. There is no need to question the authenticity of relationship with a disabled person unless anything questionable from the partner has happened. Disabled people has every right to be loved just like every other human being. Questioning its authenticity just because they are disabled is wrong . ","Everyone deserves to be loved. A person's disability doesn't define what a person is. One may be suffering from emotional disturbances and still be a kind and loving person. This is the foundation of any relationship. If your partner is right, they will love you for who you are, not abandone you because of your disability. ","This comment is ableist because it’s built on the harmful idea that people with disabilities are ""less than"" or ""not enough."" It suggests that someone’s disability might make them unlovable or that their partner’s love might be fake or out of pity.

Imagine being told that who you are something you can’t change, makes you hard to love. That’s exactly what this comment does, even if the person didn’t mean it to be mean. It treats disability as something that could ruin a relationship or make someone undeserving of love.",
46,You should learn to be happy for other people.,Yes This comment is Ableist as telling someone that you need to happy with whatever disabilities you have you should't express them . ,This comment is toxic and senseless,"This comment will make more sense in the context it was said. 
If it was said when a disabled person talks about their disability on every ocassion even in events hosted by other people to celebrate something, then this comment makes sense. 
But if this comment is made when a disabled person talks about difficulties they face in general setting then it comes across as toxic.",,
47,You are the r-word.,"Reading a comment like that on social media can be incredibly hurtful for someone with a disability. It reinforces existing stigma and prejudice, dehumanizing them and reducing their identity to a derogatory label. Such words can lead to feelings of isolation, worthlessness. . And these comments can have a lasting emotional impact, causing them to question their place in a world where they are unfairly judged and ridiculed. As a result, they may become afraid to go out.",This comment is defaming the individual by referring them as retard which refers to mentally retarded individuals ,Wow,"When someone uses this word as an insult, they are not just being mean to the person they’re talking to. They are also making all people with disabilities feel disrespected. It sends a message that having a disability is bad or something to laugh at, which is wrong and very hurtful.

Using this kind of word makes people think it’s okay to treat disabled people as less important or as a joke. This hurts people and makes the world less fair and kind for them.

We need to speak up and teach others why this is wrong. Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and kindness, no matter what.",
48,"If you were vegan, you wouldn't be disabled.","The human beings, how are vegan ia an individual things, others don't have rights to stop vegan and all human have individuals and do his own and no one Stop this and it is very toxic and not a ableist",This is undermining and invaliding people who have disability. Its not only factually incorrect but it's also degrading people who are disabled . Being vegan and being disabled is not related. Being vegan is a life style choice and being disabled is not,Ableist want convey that you had doing sean thats why your are disabled,"It's toxic because it shames the person, creating guilt or blame for something outside of their control. It’s dismissive, judgmental, and cruel, making the person feel invalidated or lesser simply because of their disability. Instead of supporting or understanding them, this comment tears them down.

This kind of statement isn’t just wrong it can be deeply hurtful and damaging to people with disabilities, who already face enough challenges and prejudices in society.",
49,"If I see another disabled person, I will use all my weapons.",The Comment is Ableist as its discriminating to tell anyone that you are disabled or You don't look disabled .,This comment seems like insensitive and harmful towards disabled people ,This comment straight away comes across as threatening and vindictive. This commenter will probably engage in content related to disability community and not acknowledge the experiences of the same. Looks like they are trying to provoke and engage in hostile behaviour.,,
50,All people with disabilities are defective.,"We're NOT defective. It's not our fault the world isn't compatible with the way we are. It's not our fault the world dealt us a sh*tty hand. We try to make the best of it and adapt to our circumstances to live a life that's comfortable and sustainable for us. I think that makes us even more resilient than neurotypical people because they couldn't even begin to understand how to navigate the world in our position. Let them walk a mile in our shoes before they start to throw around words like ""defective""","One cannot say that all people with disabilities are defective 
This may cause self esteem issues in the disabled person ",It is not the case always,,
51,Disabled people are selfish because they want to be protected.,The person who has commented on this has quite bad perceptions about disabled people. He/she considers disabled people as dependent persons and those who try to gain sympathy from others to use it to their advantage. The person needs to change his perceptions.,Being disabled is not a life choice and disabled people needs help to function in this society. They need to put in extra effort just to catch up to others . Even after all those efforts they are not seen as equals in the society. Its not selfish to have the desire to be protected. As fellow human beings its our duty to show compassion and protect them .  ,They are not selfish but situation make them to be protect themselves first,"Calling disabled people ""selfish"" for asking for safety also ignores the challenges they face. Disabled people often have to fight harder for things that others take for granted—like accessible spaces, healthcare, or even just respect. Saying they’re ""selfish"" tries to shame them into staying quiet about their needs, which is unfair and cruel.

Lastly, this comment doesn’t consider that advocating for protection doesn’t take anything away from others. Protecting disabled people helps create a better, safer world for everyone. This kind of thinking just spreads negativity and ignorance.",
52,It would be very hard to date you.,This also shows that disabled persons are not accepted and treated differently as compared to a person without a disability. This gives a sense that disabled people are a burden to that person and society. It puts one into thinking that it is a curse to be a disabled person.,I do not find a problem with the statement. I would like to know why is it hard to date the person.,It's quite toxic as it ostracised the person and makes them believe they're incapable of being loved.,,
53,You need to stay home forever.,This comment is ableist beacuse telling someone to sit at home forever due to his disabilities is ableism .,It depends on the context. Generally it is toxic to expect that someone needs to be confined to their home forever if they have a disability since every person has the right to go out and explore the world. But a statement like this might come from a place of love and care...someone who is not educated enough the disability and just wants the best for the disabled person.,I strongly believe that this comment is ableist. Having a disability does not mean that the person suffering from it should stay at home forever. They also have the right to enjoy life. People with emotional disabilities can actually benefit from going out of their homes and experiencing the world. ,,
54,I'll try to find where you are and cough into your mailbox.,,,,,
55,Your life is just suffering.,,,,,
56,It's survival of the fittest.,"It is to survival in any place and give confidence to survive and it is good words and it doesn't affect any disabled person directly, so this sentence is not at all toxic and very good toxic ","The statement is true so it does not bother me.
That said, it also depends on context.",Yeha it's always been like that ,,
57,"I don't think some disabled people should reproduce, it's very selfish.","First of all, disabilities aren't always passed down genetically. And for the ones that do get passed down, like autism, it's not a bad thing. We need more people who look at the world differently. We need a bigger group of us to exist so that we get more attention and understanding in public spaces. And finally, we're just as human as anyone else and we have the same right to have children that they do. We're not loveless. We're not incapable. We'd be perfectly good parents.","I think the statement is discriminatory. There is no reason to deny reproduction rights to someone with a disability, unless their disability can be passed on to the child.
