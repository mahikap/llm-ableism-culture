It helped me gather my thoughts on the topic and was truly beneficial. Thank you!,Interesting ,I think hate should not be part of our lives. Peace abd serenity is the way of living. ,,,"No. 
I found your survey thought provoking, thank you for inviting me.",I believe that every individual has the right to express their opinion. But not on the expense of others . Especially people who are facing any kind of disability . We should be more compassionate towards others and not discriminate against them .,Thank you for trying to make the world a better place :),,Some comments needs more context to categorise them as ableist. People have different perceptions and experiences which causes same comment to be perceived differently by different people. ,,,Speech is the double blade sword it should be properly used,,May god bless you ,No comments. ,,,Nothing
